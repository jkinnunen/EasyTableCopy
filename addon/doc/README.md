# EasyTableCopy

**EasyTableCopy** is an NVDA add-on designed to solve a common frustration: copying tables or lists from the Web or from Windows into documents (like Word, Excel, or Outlook) without losing formatting, borders, or structure.

## 1. Key Features

* **Dual Copy Engine:** Choose between "Standard" mode for best visual fidelity or "Reconstructed" mode for guaranteed structure integrity.
* **Web List Support:** Copy lists from web pages with two options — preserve original formatting (fonts, colors, links) or copy as a clean plain list (including button and interactive element text). Mark individual items to copy a subset.
* **Smart Selection:** Easily select non-adjacent rows or list items, or specific columns, to copy in a batch.
* **Desktop & Explorer Support:** Instantly convert File Explorer lists or application views into copyable tables. Copy specific columns or combinations of columns.
* **TreeView Hierarchical Copy:** Copy nested tree structures (like the Input Gestures dialog) with proper indentation and expansion states.
* **Cell-Level Copying:** Quickly copy individual cell content without the surrounding table structure.
* **Table Statistics:** Get instant information about table dimensions (row and column count) anywhere.
* **Audio Feedback:** Distinct sounds and speech messages keep you informed about the copying process.

## 2. Web Mode (Browsers)

This feature works in Browse Mode within web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

### A. The Table Copy Menu

Navigate inside any table on a website and press `NVDA + Alt + T` to open the action menu.

* **Copy Table (Standard):**
Uses the browser's native copy function.
*Pros:* Preserves exact fonts, background colors, and links.
*Cons:* Relies on the browser; empty cells might collapse in some target applications.
* **Copy Table (Reconstructed):**
The "Safe Mode." The add-on ignores the browser and manually rebuilds the table from scratch.
*Pros:* **Guarantees** that empty cells are filled (preserving borders) and enforces grid lines.
*Cons:* May lose complex CSS styling (like rounded corners).
* **Copy Current Row:** Copies only the row where your cursor is located (Standard mode).
* **Copy Current Column:** Manually extracts and copies the vertical column where your cursor is located.

### B. The List Copy Menu

Navigate inside any list on a website (bulleted or numbered) and press `NVDA + Alt + T` to open the list copy menu.

* **Copy List (With Formatting):**
Uses the browser's native copy function.
*Pros:* Preserves exact fonts, colors, links, and all other original styling.
*Cons:* Relies on the browser.
* **Copy List (Plain):**
The add-on reads the list items and builds a clean `<ul><li>` structure. Button text and interactive element labels (e.g. "Manage cookies") are now included in plain output.
*Pros:* Produces a clean, portable list. Each item is on its own line in plain text.
*Cons:* Original visual styling (fonts, colors) is not preserved.
* **Copy Marked (N items):** *(appears only when items are marked)*
Copies only the items you have individually marked. See **Smart Selection** below.
* **Clear Selections:** *(appears only when items are marked)*
Removes all current marks without copying.

### C. Smart Selection (Marking)

You can select specific items to copy in a batch. This works for both **table rows** and **web list items**. **Note:** You can mark Rows/Items OR Columns, but not both simultaneously.

#### How to Copy Specific Rows or List Items:

1. Navigate to a row or list item you want to copy.
2. Press `Control + Alt + Space`. NVDA will confirm: "Row Marked" (in tables) or "Item Marked" (in lists).
3. Move to another row or item and repeat.
4. Open the menu (`NVDA + Alt + T`) and select **"Copy Marked"**.

#### How to Copy Specific Columns:

1. Navigate to a cell within the column you want.
2. Press `Control + Alt + Shift + Space`. NVDA will confirm: "Column Marked."
3. Repeat for other columns.
4. Open the menu and select **"Copy Marked"**.

> **Note:** To clear your selections, press `Control + Alt + Windows + Space` or use the "Clear Selections" option in the menu (also available in the list menu when items are marked).

### D. Additional Web Features

* **Copy Marked Rows as Text:** After marking rows, you can copy them as plain text without table structure using the `Copy Marked as Text` command (no default key, assign in Input Gestures).
* **Copy Current Cell:** Quickly copy the content of the current cell using the `Copy Current Cell` command.

## 3. Desktop, Explorer & TreeView Mode (Windows)

EasyTableCopy also works in File Explorer, standard list views, and hierarchical trees.

### A. Quick List & Tree Copy

1. Focus on a list (e.g., a folder) or a tree item (e.g., Input Gestures).
2. Press `NVDA + Alt + T`.
3. **Result for Lists:** The entire list is converted into a structured table (with headers like Name, Date, Type) and copied to your clipboard.
4. **Result for Trees:** The entire tree is scanned from the root and copied as a hierarchical list with indentation.
* `[+]` indicates a collapsed branch.
* `[-]` indicates an expanded branch.

### B. Column-Specific Copying (Desktop & Explorer Only)

You can copy individual columns or combinations of columns from any desktop list or Explorer view. These commands only work in desktop contexts (not in web browsers).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Copy Column 1 | Copies the first column (usually Name) |
| Copy Column 2 | Copies the second column (usually Size or Type) |
| Copy Column 3 | Copies the third column (usually Date Modified) |
| Copy Columns 1-2 | Copies the first and second columns together |
| Copy Columns 1-3 | Copies the first three columns together |
| Copy Columns 1 and 3 | Copies the first and third columns (skipping the second) |

**How to use:**

1. Focus on any list or Explorer window.
2. Press the key you've assigned to the desired column command (no default keys — assign in Input Gestures).
3. The selected columns will be copied as a table with headers.

### C. Table Statistics in Desktop Mode

Press the `Table Statistics` command (no default key) to hear:

* Number of items in the folder/list
* Number of columns displayed

## 4. Universal Features (Work Everywhere)

### A. Table Statistics

Use the `Table Statistics` command anywhere (web, desktop, Explorer) to get instant information about the current table or list:

* Number of rows/items
* Number of columns

The add-on intelligently samples large tables to provide quick and accurate information without performance lag.

### B. Copy Current Cell

Use the `Copy Current Cell` command anywhere to quickly copy just the content of the current cell without the surrounding table structure. Perfect for:

* Copying specific values from web tables
* Extracting single items from lists
* Quick data entry tasks

## 5. Shortcuts Cheat Sheet

## 6. Important Notes

* **Excel/Calc Protection:** The add-on automatically disables itself in Excel and similar applications to prevent conflicts with native copy functions.
* **Selection Limitations:** You cannot mix row and column selections. Choose either rows OR columns, but not both.
* **Large Tables:** The add-on handles large tables efficiently. For very large web tables, statistics are calculated using sampling for optimal performance.
* **Web vs Desktop:** Some commands are context-specific (web-only or desktop-only) to ensure reliable operation. Commands that don't apply in the current context are simply ignored.
* **Tree Loading:** In some TreeViews, items that have never been expanded might not be available to NVDA until they are accessed.

## 7. Acknowledgments

The idea of a quick "copy table" popup menu (bound to NVDA+Alt+T) was
inspired by the table-copying feature in mltony's excellent
[Tony's Enhancements](https://github.com/mltony/nvda-tonys-enhancements)
add-on. No code was reused — EasyTableCopy implements table/row/column
extraction independently — but credit belongs where the idea originated.

Thanks are also due to ABuffEr's [Columns Review](https://github.com/ABuffEr/columnsReview)
add-on for demonstrating the value of first-class support for native
Windows list controls (SysListView32 etc.) in NVDA add-ons, which
influenced EasyTableCopy's decision to support these controls directly.
