* Fixed: Resolved an issue where tables copied via "Standard (Native)" mode would shift to the left if the first cell was empty.
* Added column-specific copying commands for desktop and Explorer (Copy Column 1, Column 2, Column 3, Columns 1-2, Columns 1-3, Columns 1 and 3)
* Added universal Table Statistics command to announce row and column counts anywhere
* Added universal Copy Current Cell command for quick cell content extraction
* Added Copy Marked as Text command for web tables (copies marked rows as plain text)
* Improved table structure detection for large web tables
* Optimized performance for large tables with intelligent sampling
* Enhanced context awareness: commands only work in appropriate contexts (web vs desktop)
* Updated documentation with all new features (English and Turkish)
* Fixed: Significantly improved the Reconstructed Copy engine and Column Selection logic to correctly handle complex table layouts.
* Fixed: Resolved an issue where vertical cell merging (rowspan) caused data from adjacent columns to shift left, leading to misaligned data.
* Added: Implemented a Virtual Matrix algorithm to track cell occupancy, ensuring that merged cells and spanned columns maintain their correct spatial coordinates during extraction.
* Improved: Enhanced reliability when copying technical data tables from modern websites using advanced CSS grid and table structures.
